# Some data clustering and embedding tools

It implements:

1. Some variations about the **Umap** embedding tool (L. Mac Innes) using Renyi entropy and hierarchical representation of neighbourhood data as provided by the Hnsw algorithm.

2. An implementation of the Mapper algorithm using the **Ripser** module from U. Bauer

3. As a by product the crate provides an implementation of some appriximated SVD as decribed in Halko-Tropp. 

## Results

### Humap

### Mapper

### Randomized SVD
