# Some data clustering and embedding tools

It implements:

1. Approximated randomized svd as described in Halko-Tropp

2. Hierachical clustering with Single Linkage.

3. A Mapper implementation based in hierarchical clustering and the Topological Data Analysis tool **Ripser** from U. Bauer

4. Some variations about the **Umap** embedding tool (L. Mac Innes) using Renyi entropy and hierarchical representation of neighbourhood data as provided by the Hnsw algorithm.
